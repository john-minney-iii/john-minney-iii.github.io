           <h1>Covid-19 and Masks</h1>
           <p>The world we live in is no longer what it used to be. Face coverings have became a social norm and a requirement in most places. When this virus started if you wore a mask in public you were given funny and dirty looks. But now if you aren't its almost like you are walking about without pants. Yet it is still considered a controverial topic.</p>
           
           <p>Looking on the news and on social media you can see that there are many people who are refusing to wear these masks. Weither they make a cry about it taking away their freedom or it making it hard for them to breath. This has became a massive argument between weither or not this is really taking away their freedom, and if those refusing to wear masks are making this virus take a longer course. Though it is a sad sight, a small peice of cloth has proven how divided our country has became.</p>

           <h1>Social Implications</h1>
           <p>When the Covid-19 outbreak first started everyone was bound to their house and many spent months alone. This was a hard time for a lot of people. Even though we have been given some ability to leave and have social interaction we have to be very careful and place it safe. One "catch" to leaving your house and being able to be around others is wearing a face covering. For a few weeks after quarantine it seemed like everything was going fine, and everyone was abiding to the new rules. However, it didn't take long for people to feel rebellious and just ignore scientists and their advice. This has created a lot of arguing and seperation not only between the two political parties, but even between people in the same party. Not only the masks, but 2020 has really opened peoples eyes to how we handle things here in America, and how we really need to stop fighting and work together.</p>

           <h1>Economic Implications</h1>
           <p>Covid-19 has a created a lot of economic problems. Everywhere you look small business and resturants have had to close because during quarantine they just didn't get enough business to be able to pay their bills. Resturants that didn't adobt the "pickup/delevery" stratagie quickly fell behind.</p>
           <p>Not only did smaller buisness feel the heat of the virus, but the pandemic has made people panic buy at bigger stores/shoping centers, and they were scalped of cleaning suplies, toiletries, and food. Just looking at social media you will see posts that say things like "Walmart on 10th has Lysole, get it while you can". It really shows some forshadowing for bigger issues.</p>

           <h1>Political Implications</h1>
           <p>Something that everyone has seen and probably read articles on is how voting is going to take place this year. For the most part it seems like Democrats are going to be using mail in ballots and Republicans are going to vote in person (for the most part). The two presidential candidates is a pretty 'touchy' topic. And with a lot of votes coming in by mail I feel like the election will take a while to actually get a for sure answer of who was voted in. So we will have to sit still and give it the time to find its way.</p>
