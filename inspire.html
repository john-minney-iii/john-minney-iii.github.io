        <h1>Inspire Page</h1>
        <p>I feel like there are far too many amazing people to choose someone to be your hero, and honestly I would probably end up choosing my dad. So instead I'm going to choose someone that inspires me in the technology world. Being a nerd that loves programming and working with electronics I love to look for projects that are both fun and impressive.</p>
        
        <p>Even though coding and playing with electronics is my passion, it can become stale if you spend all your time creating things you're being told to. There are two youtubers that really inspire me to actually have fun with my abilities and create things that are more fun than impressive.</p>

            <p>Micheal Reeves is a youtuber and former software contractor who is known for making content mainly around technology and programming. His humor is extreamly crude and can be offensive to some. He tends to avoid talking about the code in his videos to stick to the jokes. But when he starts talking you realize just how talented he is. Most of his projects he creates from scratch but he has also hacked items to do what he wants.</p>
